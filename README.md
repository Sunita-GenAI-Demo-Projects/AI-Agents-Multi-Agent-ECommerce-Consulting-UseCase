*** GenAI Multi-Agents : Automation of E-Commerce Business Use Case **

This project demonstrates the power of Recommendation and Summarization by multiple GenAI-Agents for business use-cases. In addition the project showcases the capabilities of Automation.

*** Description: *** 
This project illustrates the usage of AI-agents to solve a business situation of an e-commerce company. These AI-agents analyse the business situation, recommend and summarize the output based on Prompt Engineering. 

*** Scenario: ***
An E-Commerce company approaches a consulting firm with their vision and current business situation. The goal for the E-Commerce company is to increase revenue ($). The consulting firm then deploys AI-Agents to diagnose the situation and make recommendations.

*** Features: ***
1. This code reads txt file as input.
2. I created four AI-Agents, namely, E-Commerce Consultant, IT Consultant, Finance Consultant, Lead Consultant.
2.a.	The first three AI-agents specializes in E-Commerce, IT, Finance fields respectively. They are instructed to identify core issues and recommend next steps using Prompt Engineering. 
2.b.	I created a fourth AI-agent, Lead AI-agent who oversees the output of the other three AI-agents and synthesizes the strategy using Prompt Engineering. This Lead AI-Agent, then, summarizes the issues and recommendations.
3. This code generates an output file with summary.

*** Output: ***
